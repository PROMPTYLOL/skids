repository with discord bot tokens involved in ratting.

Essentially, discord checks GitHub for leaked bot tokens. This repo contains all tokens found that are still active to invalidate them as discord resets the token once they see it online. 

This repo is dedicated to finding and disabling ratters by deleting, nuking, and disabling discord stealers, rats, grabbers, etc.
